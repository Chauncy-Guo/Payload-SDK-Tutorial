## Overview

Using the drone flight control function of PSDK, you can set and obtain various basic parameters of the drone, control the drone to perform basic flight actions, and control the drone to perform complex flight actions through the Joystick function.

## Basic Concepts

### drone basic information

PSDK opens an interface for setting the basic parameters of the drone. By setting and obtaining the basic parameters of the drone, developers can achieve precise control of the drone:

* Enable or disable RTK function and obstacle avoidance function (horizontal obstacle avoidance and top obstacle avoidance)
* Set the home point and return altitude of the drone

An application with the function of [Information Management](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/function-set/basic-function/info-management.html) can facilitate users to obtain information about the basic parameters of the drone:

* Get the status of RTK function and obstacle avoidance function (horizontal obstacle avoidance and top obstacle avoidance)
* Get the home point and return altitude of the drone

### Basic drone flight action

The basic flight actions of the drone mainly include three categories: drone locking, drone take-off and landing, and drone return. Developers can use the interface provided by PSDK to control the drone to execute the specified operation according to the actual control requirements. flight action.

### Joystick function

Joystick is a comprehensive control function for drones. When using the Joystick function, the developer can set the coordinate system used by the drone, the horizontal control mode, and the vertical control mode by calling the interface in the Joystick according to the actual application needs. Mode, yaw angle control mode and hover mode**, can design the drone flight control logic that meets the needs of use.

#### Set coordinate system

* Body coordinate system
   The body coordinate system takes the center of gravity of the drone as the origin, the forward direction of the drone head is the X axis, the right side of the forward direction of the nose is the Y axis, the Z axis, the X axis and the Y axis are perpendicular to each other at the center of gravity and point to Below the drone (following the "Right Hand Rule"). In the body coordinates, the flight action of the drone when it rotates around the X, Y and Z axes can be called roll (the drone only rotates around the X axis), pitch (the drone only rotates around the Y axis) and yaw (the drone only rotates around the Z axis).

* Geodetic coordinate system
   The geodetic coordinate system is also called the world coordinate system or the local horizontal coordinate system. In this coordinate system, the direction of the drone pointing to the true north of the earth is the X-axis, the direction of the true east is the Y-axis, the X-axis and the Y-axis are perpendicular to each other, and the Z-axis is perpendicular to each other. The axis points vertically below the drone. On the premise of satisfying the "right-hand rule", the Z-axis will adjust the angle according to the actual situation of the drone's flight, so this coordinate system is also called "North-East-Earth (NED) coordinates. Tie".

#### Set horizontal control mode

* Attitude angle control mode: In this mode, the command in the horizontal direction is the attitude angle of the drone. (In the body coordinate system, the angle is roll and pitch)
* Speed control mode: In this mode, the command in the horizontal direction is the speed of the drone
* Position control mode: In this mode, the command in the horizontal direction is the position of the drone

> **Note:** When the modulo of the position command is not 0, the drone will fly forward at the specified speed, otherwise, the drone will hover at the specified position.

* Angular velocity control: In this mode, the command in the horizontal direction is the rotational angular velocity of the drone

##### Set the drone hover mode
Only in the speed control mode in the **horizontal control mode, the developer can set the hovering mode of the drone:

* Turn on stable mode: After turning on stable mode, the drone will hover at the specified position
* Turn off the stable mode: After turning off the stable mode, the drone will fly according to the speed command. When the forward speed of the drone is 0, the drone may flutter with the wind  

#### Set vertical control mode
* Speed control mode: control the speed of the drone in the vertical direction
* Position control mode: control the vertical position of the drone, which is an absolute position relative to the take-off point
* Throttle control mode: Control the throttle of the drone

#### Set yaw angle control mode
* Angle control mode: In this mode, the command to rotate in the yaw direction is the angle of the yaw
* Angular rate control mode: In this mode, the command to rotate in the yaw direction is the angular rate of yaw

### Drone altitude

The basic concept of altitude for DJI's drones during flight missions is shown in Table 2. The concept of drone altitude.

## Using the flight controls 
To use the aircraft flight control function, you need to initialize the flight control module first, then set the basic parameters of the aircraft, and finally use the functions in the Joystick.

#### 1. Initialize the flight control module
Before using the related interfaces of the flight control function, you need to call the `DjiTest_FlightControlInit` interface to initialize the flight control module.

```c
returnCode = DjiTest_FlightControlInit();
if (returnCode != DJI_ERROR_SYSTEM_MODULE_CODE_SUCCESS) {
    USER_LOG_ERROR("Init flight Control sample failed,error code:0x%08llX", returnCode);
    return returnCode;
}
```

#### 2. Gain control of the aircraft

Before calling the aircraft control interface, you need to call the `DjiFlightController_ObtainJoystickCtrlAuthority` interface to obtain the control authority of the aircraft. Before the aircraft control authority takes effect, the aircraft control command interface will not take effect.

```c
returnCode = DjiFlightController_ObtainJoystickCtrlAuthority();
if (returnCode != DJI_ERROR_SYSTEM_MODULE_CODE_SUCCESS) {
    USER_LOG_ERROR("Obtain joystick authority failed, error code: 0x%08X", returnCode);
    goto out;
}
s_osalHandler->TaskSleepMs(1000);
```

#### 3. Get and set aircraft parameters

Before controlling the automatic flight of the aircraft, it is necessary to check and set the relevant parameters of the aircraft. The flight control module provides a series of Set and Get interfaces, which can obtain and set the aircraft parameters and take effect in real time.

```c
/*! Turn on horizontal vision avoid enable */
    USER_LOG_INFO("--> Step 1: Turn on horizontal visual obstacle avoidance");
    DjiTest_WidgetLogAppend("--> Step 1: Turn on horizontal visual obstacle avoidance");
    returnCode = DjiFlightController_SetHorizontalVisualObstacleAvoidanceEnableStatus(
        DJI_FLIGHT_CONTROLLER_ENABLE_OBSTACLE_AVOIDANCE);
    if (returnCode != DJI_ERROR_SYSTEM_MODULE_CODE_SUCCESS) {
        USER_LOG_ERROR("Turn on horizontal visual obstacle avoidance failed, error code: 0x%08X", returnCode);
        goto out;
    };
    s_osalHandler->TaskSleepMs(1000);

    USER_LOG_INFO("--> Step 2: Get horizontal horizontal visual obstacle status\r\n");
    DjiTest_WidgetLogAppend("--> Step 2: Get horizontal horizontal visual obstacle status\r\n");
    returnCode = DjiFlightController_GetHorizontalVisualObstacleAvoidanceEnableStatus(
        &horizontalVisualObstacleAvoidanceStatus);
    if (returnCode != DJI_ERROR_SYSTEM_MODULE_CODE_SUCCESS) {
        USER_LOG_ERROR("Get horizontal visual obstacle avoidance failed, error code: 0x%08X", returnCode);
        goto out;
    }
    USER_LOG_INFO("Current horizontal visual obstacle avoidance status is %d\r\n",
                  horizontalVisualObstacleAvoidanceStatus);
    s_osalHandler->TaskSleepMs(1000);

    /*! Turn on horizontal radar avoid enable */
    USER_LOG_INFO("--> Step 3: Turn on horizontal radar obstacle avoidance");
    DjiTest_WidgetLogAppend("--> Step 3: Turn on horizontal radar obstacle avoidance");
    returnCode = DjiFlightController_SetHorizontalRadarObstacleAvoidanceEnableStatus(
        DJI_FLIGHT_CONTROLLER_ENABLE_OBSTACLE_AVOIDANCE);
    if (returnCode != DJI_ERROR_SYSTEM_MODULE_CODE_SUCCESS) {
        USER_LOG_ERROR("Turn on horizontal radar obstacle avoidance failed, error code: 0x%08X", returnCode);
        goto out;
    };
    s_osalHandler->TaskSleepMs(1000);
```

#### 4. Control the aircraft to perform basic flight actions

Using the interface provided by PSDK, the developer can control the drone to perform the specified flight action according to the actual control requirements. Considering the safety of flight control, it is recommended to subscribe the relevant aircraft parameters through data subscription for closed-loop inspection and control to ensure the correct execution of flight actions.

```c
T_DjiReturnCode djiStat;

//! Start takeoff
djiStat = DjiFlightController_StartTakeoff();
if (djiStat != DJI_ERROR_SYSTEM_MODULE_CODE_SUCCESS) {
    USER_LOG_ERROR("Request to take off failed, error code: 0x%08X", djiStat);
    return false;
}

//! Motors start check
if (!DjiTest_FlightControlMotorStartedCheck()) {
    USER_LOG_ERROR("Takeoff failed. Motors are not spinning.");
    return false;
} else {
    USER_LOG_INFO("Motors spinning...");
}
//! In air check
if (!DjiTest_FlightControlTakeOffInAirCheck()) {
    USER_LOG_ERROR("Takeoff failed. Aircraft is still on the ground, but the "
                   "motors are spinning");
    return false;
} else {
    USER_LOG_INFO("Ascending...");
}
//! Finished takeoff check
if (!takeoffFinishedCheck()) {
    USER_LOG_ERROR("Takeoff finished, but the aircraft is in an unexpected mode. "
                   "Please connect DJI GO.");
    return false;
}
```

#### 5. Using the functions in Joystick

To use the Joystick function, you need to set the Joystick mode and corresponding control commands first, and then execute the Joystick commands to control the drone. The following code is to use the Joystick function to control the drone to move to the specified position in the horizontal and vertical directions.

1. Set the mode of the joystick
```c
T_DjiFlightControllerJoystickMode joystickMode = {
        DJI_FLIGHT_CONTROLLER_HORIZONTAL_POSITION_CONTROL_MODE,
        DJI_FLIGHT_CONTROLLER_VERTICAL_POSITION_CONTROL_MODE,
        DJI_FLIGHT_CONTROLLER_YAW_ANGLE_CONTROL_MODE,
        DJI_FLIGHT_CONTROLLER_HORIZONTAL_GROUND_COORDINATE,
        DJI_FLIGHT_CONTROLLER_STABLE_CONTROL_MODE_ENABLE,
    };

DjiFlightController_SetJoystickMode(joystickMode);
```
> **Note:** If you do not change the settings in the Joystick during the flight of the drone, you can only set the Joystick mode when the drone starts to fly.

2. Set up Joystick control commands and perform Joystick functions
> **Note:** The z-axis position in `joystickCommand` is the absolute height relative to the height of the take-off point.

```c
    while (elapsedTimeInMs < timeoutInMilSec) {
        T_DjiFcSubscriptionPositionFused currentGPSPosition = DjiTest_FlightControlGetValueOfPositionFused();
        T_DjiFcSubscriptionQuaternion currentQuaternion = DjiTest_FlightControlGetValueOfQuaternion();
        dji_f32_t currentHeight = DjiTest_FlightControlGetValueOfRelativeHeight();
        if (originHeightBaseHomePoint == -1) {
            USER_LOG_ERROR("Relative height is invalid!");
            return false;
        }

        float yawInRad = DjiTest_FlightControlQuaternionToEulerAngle(currentQuaternion).z;
        //! get the vector between aircraft and origin point.

        T_DjiTestFlightControlVector3f localOffset = DjiTest_FlightControlLocalOffsetFromGpsAndFusedHeightOffset(
            currentGPSPosition,
            originGPSPosition,
            currentHeight,
            originHeightBaseHomePoint);
        //! get the vector between aircraft and target point.
        T_DjiTestFlightControlVector3f offsetRemaining = DjiTest_FlightControlVector3FSub(offsetDesired, localOffset);

        T_DjiTestFlightControlVector3f positionCommand = offsetRemaining;
        DjiTest_FlightControlHorizCommandLimit(speedFactor, &positionCommand.x, &positionCommand.y);

        T_DjiFlightControllerJoystickCommand joystickCommand = {positionCommand.x, positionCommand.y, offsetDesired.z + originHeightBaseHomePoint, yawDesiredInDeg};
        DjiFlightController_ExecuteJoystickAction(joystickCommand);

        if (DjiTest_FlightControlVectorNorm(offsetRemaining) < posThresholdInM &&
            fabs(yawInRad / s_degToRad - yawDesiredInDeg) < yawThresholdInDeg) {
            //! 1. We are within bounds; start incrementing our in-bound counter
            withinBoundsCounter += cycleTimeInMs;
        } else {
            if (withinBoundsCounter != 0) {
                //! 2. Start incrementing an out-of-bounds counter
                outOfBounds += cycleTimeInMs;
            }
        }
        //! 3. Reset withinBoundsCounter if necessary
        if (outOfBounds > outOfControlBoundsTimeLimit) {
            withinBoundsCounter = 0;
            outOfBounds = 0;
        }
        //! 4. If within bounds, set flag and break
        if (withinBoundsCounter >= withinControlBoundsTimeReqmt) {
            break;
        }
        s_osalHandler->TaskSleepMs(cycleTimeInMs);
        elapsedTimeInMs += cycleTimeInMs;
    }

    while (brakeCounter < withinControlBoundsTimeReqmt) {
        s_osalHandler->TaskSleepMs(cycleTimeInMs);
        brakeCounter += cycleTimeInMs;
    }

    if (elapsedTimeInMs >= timeoutInMilSec) {
        USER_LOG_ERROR("Task timeout!");
        return false;
    }
```

#### 6. Release the aircraft control

After completing a series of controls on the aircraft, you need to call `DjiFlightController_ReleaseJoystickCtrlAuthority` to release the control of the aircraft so that other devices can take over the control of the aircraft.

```c
returnCode = DjiFlightController_ReleaseJoystickCtrlAuthority();
if (returnCode != DJI_ERROR_SYSTEM_MODULE_CODE_SUCCESS) {
    USER_LOG_ERROR("Release joystick authority failed, error code: 0x%08X", returnCode);
    goto out;
}
```
